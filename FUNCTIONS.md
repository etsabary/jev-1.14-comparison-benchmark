# All 31 text decision functions

All 20 rows in the current ranking cover all 1,342 questions. [Overall results](README.md). The six F26-F31 functions have eight questions each; one answer changes a category score by 12.5 percentage points.

| ID | Function | What it tests | Simple illustration | Questions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F01 | Lookup and filtering | Select records that meet stated conditions | Which listed request is both signed and marked urgent? | 43 |
| F02 | Forward conditionals | Apply an implication from its trigger | If an active badge grants entry and this badge is active, what follows? | 46 |
| F03 | Necessary conditions | Reason backward from a missing required condition | Every approved request needs a valid ticket; can one without a ticket be approved? | 52 |
| F04 | Boolean scope | Track combinations such as both, either and exactly one | Which choice satisfies exactly one of two stated conditions? | 54 |
| F05 | Quantifiers and sets | Track all, some, none and overlapping groups | All teal tokens are marked; no marked token is blank; which relation follows? | 49 |
| F06 | Comparisons | Combine ordered comparisons | A is taller than B and B than C; how do A and C compare? | 40 |
| F07 | Scheduling | Fit events around order and exclusion rules | Which timetable puts one meeting before another without overlapping a break? | 76 |
| F08 | One-to-one assignments | Give each item a unique partner while satisfying clues | Assign three people different desks using location restrictions. | 67 |
| F09 | Exact truth counting | Count precisely how many statements hold | Under the supplied facts, how many of six claims are true? | 71 |
| F10 | Truth-teller consistency | Find a consistent pattern of truthful and false statements | Which assignment of honest and dishonest speakers fits their claims? | 74 |
| F11 | Sufficiency and inconsistency | Determine whether facts force an answer or contradict one another | Is a proposed arrangement determined, impossible or still underdetermined? | 41 |
| F12 | Object swaps | Update locations after repeated exchanges | A red token starts in box A; several box contents are swapped; where does it end? | 52 |
| F13 | Sequential procedures | Apply each ordered edit to the current state | Toggle one flag, swap two values, then conditionally reset another flag. | 48 |
| F14 | Temporal intervals | Compare starts, ends and overlapping periods | Which interval overlaps a specified event without containing it? | 42 |
| F15 | Spatial tracking | Update position or direction from described movement | Follow successive turns and moves, then identify the final direction. | 49 |
| F16 | Reference binding | Resolve chains of names, roles and references | Identify the mentor of the colleague named in a nested description. | 50 |
| F17 | Beliefs and perspectives | Distinguish what different observers witnessed | An object moves while one observer is absent; where will that observer look? | 50 |
| F18 | Causal intervention | Recompute consequences of changing a specified input | Force a switch off while holding other inputs fixed; which lamp now lights? | 50 |
| F19 | Exceptions and priorities | Apply a rule, its exception and stated precedence | A badge permits entry unless a higher-priority suspension applies. | 58 |
| F20 | Planning | Choose an action sequence whose requirements are met | Obtain a key before opening a locked door, with limited moves available. | 43 |
| F21 | Directed reachability | Follow arrows in their permitted direction | Can node A reach node D through the listed directed links? | 43 |
| F22 | Preference ordering | Rank candidates using explicit tie-break rules | Rank by priority first, then age when priorities tie. | 51 |
| F23 | Rule counterexamples | Find a case that violates a stated rule | Which listed record disproves the claim that every approved item is signed? | 52 |
| F24 | Authority and stale records | Select the valid source rather than an outdated conflicting one | Two records disagree; which controls under the stated authority and date policy? | 43 |
| F25 | Fault diagnosis | Match observed symptoms to explicit fault rules | Which fault is consistent with the supplied test results? | 50 |
| F26 | Probabilistic risk | Choose an action by expected loss from supplied probabilities and costs. | Which action minimizes the expected cost of a possible delay? | 8 |
| F27 | Value of information | Choose whether a test is worth buying before a later decision. | Will the information change the action enough to justify its price? | 8 |
| F28 | Robust decisions without a prior | Minimize worst-case loss or regret without inventing probabilities. | Which policy has the smallest worst-case loss across permitted worlds? | 8 |
| F29 | Strategic decisions | Choose while anticipating another actor maximizing their own payoff. | Which first move is best after accounting for the other player’s response? | 8 |
| F30 | Concurrent-history consistency | Check whether overlapping operations fit a valid atomic order. | Can these read and write replies belong to one order consistent with their timing? | 8 |
| F31 | Information-flow security | Check whether observable behavior reveals a forbidden secret distinction. | Could two permitted secret states be distinguished from the public output? | 8 |
